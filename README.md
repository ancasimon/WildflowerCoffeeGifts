# WildflowerCoffeeGifts

Our last group project in our bootcamp was a full-stack full CRUD application using C# and .NET Core framework for the backend and a React application for the frontend and combining two of our favorite things: flowers and coffee!

## Personal Contribution
My focus during our group project was on the shopping cart workflow - starting with the user's ability to view a single product page and add the product to their cart, through updating the cart as needed with more of the same product or additional products, and finishing with the checkout process, which includes delivery and billing data.
