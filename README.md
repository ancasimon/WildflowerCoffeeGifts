# WildflowerCoffeeGifts

Our last group project in our bootcamp was a full-stack application using C# and ASP .NET Core framework for the backend, with a SQL database, and a React application for the frontend. This project combines two of our favorite things: flowers and coffee! It is an e-commerce site where users can order flower bouquets in eclectic reusable coffee mugs. 

## Individual Contribution
My individual contributions in the project included:
* Setting up routing throughout the application.
* The product details page, where users can view a single product.
* The full shopping cart experience - from placing a product in the cart, through updating the cart as needed with more of the same product or additional products, and finishing with the checkout process, which includes delivery and billing data and placing the order. 
* Ability to add a new payment type during checkout. 
* Creating ERD and mockups for the application workflows and pages.
